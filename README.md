# MIT-6.00.2x
Introduction to computational thinking and data science

I started [this course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-7) six weeks before the end of course deadline and worked through the ontent in four weeks, using the recommended [course text book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-second-edition) as a backup. Most of the statistics and math content was straightforward as I already had A level understanding in statistics. 

I took a week break to get married and fulfil various social obligations, then crammed for the mid-term and final exams, taking the final on the last day before the deadline. This was an intense experience, self-imposed, It was useful to know that I could perform under pressure, taking the exams without having practiced as much as I would have liked. My final course grade was 95%. I was pleased, given that I took the exams exhausted and stressed and felt like I was coding the last questions in my sleep. 

The course divides into five units with a mid-term quiz and final exam. Each of the first four units contain three lecutures with videos and finger exercises and a problem set. The fifth unit has two lectures and no problem set. 

Units 1 covers:
  - optimization
  - knapsack (bin) problems
  - decision trees and dynamic programming
  - graph problems 
 
Unit 2 covers plotting, stochastic thinking and random walks

Unit 3: 
  - inferential statistics
  - Monte Carlo simulations
  - sampling and standard error
 
Unit 4 is all about experimental data and unit 5 is a basic introduction to machine learning and statistical fallacies. 

In this repo each course week folder contains exercises from the online course, sometimes exercises from the chapters in the textbook covering the same material and my attempts at and solutions for the problem sets. 

Much of the math and the programming syntax was familiar. What was great about this course, for me, was application of math problems, combbinations and permutations for example, to real life examples through programming.
