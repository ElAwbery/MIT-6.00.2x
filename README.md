# MIT-6.00.2x
Introduction to computational thinking and data science

I started [this course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-7) six weeks before the end of course deadline and worked through the ontent in four weeks, using the recommended [course text book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-second-edition) as a backup. Most of the statistics and math content was straightforward as I already know basic statistics. 

I took a week break then crammed in the final week for the two exams, taking the final on the last day before the deadline. I wanted to complete the course before the deadline and it was useful to know that I could perform under pressure, taking the exams without having practiced as much as I would have liked. My final course grade was 95%. 

The course divides into five units with a mid-term and final exam. Each of the first four units contain three lecutures with videos and finger exercises and a problem set. The fifth unit has two lectures and no problem set. 

Units 1 covers:
  - optimization
  - knapsack (bin) problems
  - decision trees and dynamic programming
  - graph problems 
 
Unit 2 covers plotting, stochastic thinking and random walks

Unit 3: 
  - inferential statistics
  - Monte Carlo simulations
  - sampling and standard error
 
Unit 4 is all about experimental data and unit 5 is a basic introduction to machine learning and statistical fallacies. 

Much of the math and the programming syntax was familiar. What was great about this course for me was application of math problems such as combinations and permutations to real life examples through programming. This is the first time I used matplotlib and plotting tools in Python. Check out some of my plots in [week 2.](https://github.com/ElAwbery/MIT-6.00.2x/blob/master/Week%202/linear_comparisons.png )
I loved the problem set for week 3, a [simulation of the spread of a virus in patients](https://github.com/ElAwbery/MIT-6.00.2x/blob/master/Week%203/ProblemSet3%203/ps3b.py) given different properties of medications applied and viral resistance. 

Each course week folder here contains exercises from the online course, sometimes exercises from the chapters in the textbook covering the same material and my attempts at and solutions for the problem sets.
